# Department Index

This program manages a company's departments and employees. It allows you to:
- Add employees to specific departments.
- Retrieve a sorted list of employees in a department.
- Retrieve a sorted list of all employees across all departments.

It is the third exercise in Chapter 8, and exercises Hash maps and Vectors, but I tried to increase the scope a little bit to exercise much more, including writing a minimal input parser and splitting my project up into logical parts.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the program using Cargo:
   ```bash
   $ cargo run
   ```
3. Insert commands. You can enter the `help` command to show all available commands.

## Sample Input File

The `sample.txt` file contains example input that can be fed into the program to demonstrate its functionality. You can create or modify this file to test different scenarios.

### Example Terminal Session

```bash
$ cargo run < sample.txt
```

This will process the input from `sample.txt` and display the results in the terminal.
